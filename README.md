# gridcontrol-bems
The building energy management system (BEMS) that has been devloped for the research project "grid-control". 


One central goal of grid-control is the impementation of the BDEW smart grid traffic light concept that assigns traffic light phases to each network semgent.
Simplified: Depending on the traffic light phase the energy market can trade freely, has to obey restrictions or is interrupted by the distribution system operator.

In this context, the BEMS collects local flexibility using a generic interface, conducts optimization for self-consumption and offers an aggregated flexibility to a participant of the energy market.
During a red traffic light phase the BEMS interrupts its normal operation and controls the local devices according to the signals provided by the distribution system operator.

More Information will follow!
